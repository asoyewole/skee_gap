üîπ Step 2: NLP Preprocessing & Skill Extraction
Goal:

Prepare resume & job description text for comparison and scoring. Extract relevant skills, keywords, and entities to build features for similarity analysis.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Text Cleaning & Normalization

Objectives: Remove noise, standardize text.

Actions:

Lowercase all text.

Remove emails, URLs, phone numbers.

Remove special characters, extra whitespace.

Optional: lemmatization (convert words to root form).

Python Tools: re for regex, nltk or spaCy for tokenization & lemmatization.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tokenization & Stopword Removal

Objectives: Split text into words or phrases and remove unimportant/common words.

Actions:

Tokenize text using spaCy or nltk.word_tokenize.

Remove stopwords (the, a, and, of...).

Optional: remove very short tokens (<2 characters).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Skill/Keyword Extraction

Two approaches:

A. Predefined Skills Dictionary

Build or use a skills list (from datasets like skills-ner or StackOverflow/LinkedIn skill lists).

Match resume & job description text against this list (case-insensitive substring match or fuzzy match).

Output: List of skills found in resume and in job description.

B. NLP-based Extraction

Use NER (Named Entity Recognition) to detect skills/entities in text.

spaCy pretrained model (en_core_web_sm) can identify ORG, WORK_OF_ART, etc.

Optional: train a custom NER model for skills (advanced).

Use noun chunk extraction to find phrases like ‚Äúdata analysis‚Äù, ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù, ‚ÄúPython programming‚Äù.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Vectorization / Embeddings

Convert resume & job description text into numerical form for similarity analysis.

Options:

TF-IDF Vectors (basic, interpretable).

Sentence Embeddings using sentence-transformers (state-of-the-art).

Example model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Generates 384-dimensional vectors for each text.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Output from Step 2

After Step 2, you‚Äôll have:

Cleaned text for resume & job description.

List of skills/keywords extracted from each.

Vector embeddings for similarity scoring.

Next Steps After Step 2

Step 3 ‚Üí Similarity & Scoring Engine:

Compute cosine similarity between resume & job embeddings.

Compare skills lists ‚Üí compute missing vs matched skills.

Output overall match score.
